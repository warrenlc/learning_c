This is a remake of a lab we did for a class
in object oriented programming in C++ where
the purpose was to learn about inheritance
and polymorphism.

I want to learn C, so I am starting by
re-doing some of these C++ labs in C. 
Mainly because certain things are similar
but also very different. I might redo this
C - version yet again to see how I might
"simulate" polymorphism and inheritance in 
C. This time, I just did it very "imperatively".

As for my own thoughts on this, I think the code
is actually far easier to read. Because the abstractions
are minimal (just structs and variable names!) vs. an OO
approach it is pretty straight forward. I DID find myself
wanting to have access to more containers.

I am sure good C programmers know many ways around this but
this is precisely why I am learning. 

I did NOT miss error-handling. I have alwyas been of the opinion
that manual error-checking is to be preferred--You really need to
know what you are doing vs simply try/catch etc. 

** Interesting: 

I ran $ wc -w * in this folder and got: 1631 words total for all 
files for this lab, redone in C.

Doing the same in the same folder for C++:
    5307 !!!!!
So it's not my imagination that it felt like I had far less
to write despite not having access to "reusable code" by taking
advantage of containers (to loop over) or inheritance...
